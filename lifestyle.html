              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lifestyle</strong> is defined as how individuals live their lives.
                It includes their daily behaviors, choices, and habits. Lifestyle encompasses a range of factors
                including diet, physical activity, sleep patterns, stress management, social interactions, and substance
                use. These factors affect the overall well-being and health status of an individual. Below are
                lifestyles that affect the respiratory and circulatory systems.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> Additionally, these factors affect the overall well-being and health
                status of an individual. Below are lifestyles that affect the respiratory and circulatory systems.</p>

          <h2>Smoking</h2>
          <img style="height: 600px" src="assets/img/lifestyle/smoking.jpg" alt="">
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 15px;">Smoking involves the intentional act of inhaling and
            exhaling the smoke
            produced from tobacco rolled into cigarettes, cigars, or pipers. Cigarettes have a content of toxic
            chemicals; hence they are harmful, especially to the respiratory health. The harmful substances in
            cigarettes include nicotine, which is the primary addictive agent that makes smokers dependent on it, tar,
            which is a sticky substance that coats and damages lung tissues over time, carbon monoxide, which reduces
            oxygen delivery to the cells, and other thousands of compounds, including carcinogens or the cancer-causing
            substances. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">People who do not smoke can be affected by smoking as well. Passive smoking or
            secondhand smoking exposure happens when a person breathes in cigarette smoke blown by a smoker. Even brief
            exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful and can cause health problems to the individual. </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Tobacco usage in the Philippines</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">A Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted by the Philippine Statistics
            Authority (PSA) and the Department of Health (DOH) IN 2021, revealed that 1 in 5, or 15.1 million Filipino
            individuals aged 15 years and older, are current tobacco users. Male smokers have eight times higher
            percentage than female smokers. It was also concluded in the GATS that there has been a decline in tobacco
            users from 29.7% in 2009 to 19.5% in 2021. On average, daily smokers consume about 10 cigarettes.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">It was also found that 2.5 million individuals were exposed to tobacco smoke
            in their respective workplaces. Moreover, about 16.8 million were exposed to tobacco smoke inside their
            homes. Filipinos are also exposed to secondhand smoke in public places.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Executive Order No. 26, entitled Providing Establishment of Smoke-Free
            Environments in Public and Eclosed Places (nationwide smoking ban order) was implemented by President
            Rodrigo Duterte on May 16, 2017. These mandates provide a smoke-free environment, conducting information
            dissemination and awareness campaigns to educate the public about the harmful effects of smoking, and
            penalizing those who do not comply. Minors are also protected from purchasing, selling, and distributing
            tobacco products. </p>
          <h2>Health Consequences from Tobacco Use</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 8 million
            individuals die from tobacco use every year, as of November 2023. From this, 1.3 million are non-smokers who
            were exposed to secondhand smoke.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Data from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP), shows that an average of
            321 deaths caused by tobacco-related diseases were recorded, which amounts to 112,000 deaths yearly.</p>

              <h3>Respiratory Diseases Caused by Smoking:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lung Cancer</strong> - all smokers (firsthand & secondhand) are at
                risk for lung cancer. The leading cause of this disease is tobacco use.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) </strong> - it is a
                chronic inflammatory lung disease, which restricts natural airflow in the body causing difficulty
                breathing in individuals. Smoking accounts for 70% of COPD cases. This disease is also called emphysema
                or chronic bronchitis. </p>
              <!-- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pneumonia </strong> is inflammation and fluid in the lungs caused by either bacterial or fungal infections. Smokers are at increased risk of developing pneumonia as active smoking damages the lungs' natural defense mechanisms. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asthma  </strong> is a chronic lung disease caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways. Exposure to smoke and other allergens increases the risk of individuals to have asthma attacks. </p> -->

            <div class="col-6">
              <h3>Circulatory Diseases Caused by Smoking:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heart Disease </strong> - smoking not only affects the lungs, but
                it
                also targets other organs in the body including the heart. Smoking causes blockage and narrows the
                arteries, making it harder for the blood and oxygen to flow to your heart. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stroke </strong> - a disease caused by either a blocked artery in
                the brain (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel in the brain (hemorrhagic
                stroke). Smoking increases the risk of developing a stroke by contributing to the formation of blood
                clots and damaged blood vessels in the body. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Alcohol Intake</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alcoholic beverages</strong> are any drink that contains ethanol.
                It is classified as a drug, a central nervous system depressant that greatly impacts public health.
                Moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may have mild effects, like relaxation and social
                inhibition. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> However, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of health
                problems including liver disease, heart disease, addiction, and mental health disorders. This lifestyle
                can affect the long-term health of the individual. While it is socially acceptable and legal to consume
                alcohol, it is important to recognize its potential risks and consequences when it is consumed
                irresponsibly.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Alcohol use in the Philippines</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">A survey conducted by the Department of Health in 2021 showed that an
            estimated 40% of Filipino adults drink alcohol, 33% of which are heavy drinkers. Drinking or inuman has been
            part of almost every Family, friendship, and community. It was revealed in a study that drinking has been
            part of their lifestyle: 45.5% of respondents said they drink alcohol to socialize, 23.8% drink to remove
            stress and burden, and 17.5% say they drink to be happy and gain pleasure.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The legal drinking age in the Philippines is 18, but minors can easily
            purchase alcoholic drinks in stores. Children start drinking as early as 15 years old. Data from the World
            Health Organization indicates that almost 9% of the Filipino population who are 15 years and older have an
            alcohol use disorder.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Death attributed to drinking among Filipino individuals is estimated to be
            39,802 in the year 2019. Moreover, 25% of fatalities in traffic accidents are thought to be caused by drunk
            driving. And because excessive alcohol use can lower inhibitions and cloud a person’s judgments, there is a
            higher risk of committing violent offenses and displaying aggressive behavior.</p>
          <h2>Alcohol use in the Philippines</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), alcohol is classified as a
            psychoactive substance that affects the way a person thinks and behaves. Alcohol consumption is also a
            causal factor in more than 200 diseases, injuries, and adverse health conditions among individuals.</p>

              <h3>Respiratory Diseases Caused by Alcoholism:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asthma </strong> - alcoholic beverages contain substances called
                histamines and sulfites, which may cause asthma symptoms in some people. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choking or aspiration pneumonia </strong> - excessive alcohol
                intake increases the risk of vomiting. A person under alcohol intoxication is at higher risk of vomiting
                and inhaling their vomit, which can lead to choking or aspiration pneumonia. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Lung Injury and Disease </strong> - heavy alcohol consumption can
                reduce levels of the antioxidant glutathione, which protects the smaller airways of the lungs from
                oxidative damage. Excessive alcohol intake makes the lungs more prone to serious injury and disease.

                person’s risk of stroke. Alcohol abuse is linked to over 1 million strokes each year, globally. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High blood pressure </strong> - is the most common alcohol-related
                health problem. Drinking a large amount of alcohol can affect the muscles in the blood vessels, which
                makes them narrower, making the risk of developing hypertension higher. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heat Failure </strong> - prolonged alcohol abuse weakens the heart
                muscle and impairs its ability to pump blood effectively, leading to heart failure. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Sedentary Lifestyle</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> A <strong>sedentary lifestyle or inactive lifestyle</strong> refers to a
                way of living that involves minimal to no physical activity. A person who has a sedentary lifestyle
                spends six or more hours per day either sitting or lying down, lacking significant physical movement in
                their day-to-day life. An example of sedentary behavior is sitting at a desk at school or work, playing
                computer games or surfing the internet at home, and driving a car or sitting in a vehicle when
                traveling. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), sedentary
                lifestyles have increased prevalently worldwide. The advancement of technology had a significant impact
                on promoting sedentary behavior. Devices such as computers, smartphones, and televisions offer a
                sedentary form of entertainment and communication making people spend more time engaged in screen-based
                activities. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Health Consequences of Sedentary Lifestyle</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized that physical inactivity can
            cause severe effects on people’s health. According to WHO, 60 to 85% of people in the world lead sedentary
            lifestyles, making it one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health issues. A sedentary
            lifestyle doubles the risk of acquiring cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and even depression and
            anxiety. </p>

              <h3>Effects on the Respiratory System:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Decreased Lung Capacity </strong> - prolonged periods of physical
                inactivity can lead to the weakening of the respiratory muscles, resulting in a reduced ability to take
                deep breaths and a decreased lung capacity. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Reduced Oxygen Efficiency </strong> - individuals with a
                sedentary lifestyle may have lower oxygen utilization efficiency. Their bodies are less efficient at
                extracting and using oxygen from the air they breathe. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Increased Risk of Respiratory Conditions </strong> - a
                sedimentary lifestyle is associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory conditions such as
                asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. </p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Decreased Cardiovascular Fitness</strong> - lack of physical
                activity can lead to a decline in cardiovascular fitness, which is the ability of the heart, blood
                vessels, and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to the body’s tissues during physical activity. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Increased blood pressure </strong> - sedentary individuals are
                more likely to develop high blood pressure (hypertension), which can strain the heart and blood vessels,
                increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Altered Blood Lipid Levels </strong> - a sedentary lifestyle can
                contribute to an unfavorable blood lipid profile, with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
                cholesterol and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increasing the risk of
                atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Unhealthy Diet</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Diet</strong> is one of the essential factors that affect the
                health of an individual. The food that we consume is the source of nutrients that we need to grow and
                perform bodily functions. A diet is considered unhealthy if it is high in unhealthy components like
                calories, refined sugar, saturated and trans-fat, and sodium. These foods undergo a lot of processes
                stripping off their nutritional value. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> Highly processed goods are the most common type of unhealthy foods. This
                can include items like fast foods, canned goods, junk foods, and highly-sweetened beverages. Eating a
                healthier option of food is not always easy, as raw food prices for meat, fish, and even fruits and
                vegetables are more expensive than processed ones. Lower-income households often rely more on cheap,
                convenient, processed foods, hence there is a high amount of malnourished or under nutrition children.
                In some cases, consuming highly processed foods daily leads to obesity and chronic diseases. </p>

              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Decreased Cardiovascular Fitness</strong> - lack of physical
                activity can lead to a decline in cardiovascular fitness, which is the ability of the heart, blood
                vessels, and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to the body’s tissues during physical activity. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Increased blood pressure </strong> - sedentary individuals are
                more likely to develop high blood pressure (hypertension), which can strain the heart and blood vessels,
                increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Altered Blood Lipid Levels </strong> - a sedentary lifestyle can
                contribute to an unfavorable blood lipid profile, with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
                cholesterol and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increasing the risk of
                atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Poor Sleeping Habits</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Poor Sleeping Habits</strong> refer to the behavior and routines
                that disrupt the quality and quantity of sleep a person gets. This lifestyle can hurt the overall health
                of an individual. it is important to follow the recommended sleep duration for different age groups to
                have a night of good-quality sleep. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> One of the primary causes of poor sleeping habits is the presence of
                technology in our daily lives. From television to smartphones, to laptops, and gaming consoles, these
                technological devices have become a part of our routine. When used excessively, without limitation,
                these can lead to disrupted sleep patterns and compromised sleep quality. Technology become so
                addictive, that some people sacrifice their sleep over screen-time activities. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> Sleep deprivation happens when a person fails to get the right amount of
                sleep that they need. When this gets severe or if it happens over an extended period, it can eventually
                lead to disruptive symptoms that interfere with the daily life of a person. It could also heighten the
                risk of major health complications. In a Philips survey in 2021, among Asian countries, Filipinos have
                one of the highest rates of sleep deprivation; 46% of Filipinos do not get enough sleep. </p>

            <div class="col-6 mt-4">
              <h3>Effects on the Respiratory System:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Impaired Lung Function </strong> - insufficient sleep can reduce
                lung capacity, lower oxygen saturation levels, and impair the lungs’ ability to clear mucus and other
                airway irritants which can lead to an increased risk of respiratory distress. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Increased Risk of Pulmonary Hypertension </strong> - research has
                connected poor sleep quality and duration to the onset and development of pulmonary hypertension. Poor
                sleeping habits can disrupt the normal regulation of blood vessels in the lungs, which leads to
                constriction and elevated pressure. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Increased Risk of Respiratory Infections </strong> - sleep
                deprivation weakens the immune system, making the individuals more prone to respiratory infections like
                the common cold, flu, and pneumonia. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6 mt-4">
              <h3>Effects on the Circulatory System:</h3>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Coronary Heart Disease </strong> - deprivation can contribute to
                factors such as inflammation and hypertension which are associated with an elevated risk of coronary
                heart disease. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> High Blood Pressure </strong> - when the body lacks sleep, it
                releases more stress hormones that can narrow the blood vessels and make the heart work harder to pump
                blood. This can lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and
                stroke. </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Stroke </strong> - getting enough sleep over time leads to
                disruption in the blood vessels and increased inflammation in the body. When this happens, blood clots
                may form which can block blood flow to the brain, leading to stroke. </p>
